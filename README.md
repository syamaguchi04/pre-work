## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/
   https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   A challenge I encountered when creating this submission was figuring out the overall layout and how to convey the tone I wanted.
   I personally have had difficulties with computer science langauges. I have gotten Cs the past two times I have taken a computer science class and
   this is currently my third time attempting to overcome this barrier. While I have numerous design ideas I find interesting, making it come to life is
   always difficult. I am most likely not the only one that feels this way but with my understanding and skill level, it's far.
   Thinking like a computer scientist/coder has been difficult and takes a lot of time for me to understand.
   I was proud of getting a background to appear from an URL, which is not a hard thing to do according to all the resources I have looked at.
   But being able to come this far, personally, shows I have been overcoming my weakness towards computer science. I was able to achieve a layout
   that was more or less close to what I had envisioned with my limited skill set and understanding. I am also having fun and understanding
   new terms and how it relates to other technological industries. (i.e. href with cybersecurity, and html toggling)

3) What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I am wondering if all web pages are just a different version of the html, js, and css I have created. Do websites import or create their own personal layout
   or can everything be created in a similar matter like this pre-work with time and skill?
   If a feature that was never done before is required by a client how do web developers go about it? Most likely there are no prior tools or resources
   to fall back to. While everything is an extension of itself and eventually a web developer can connect the dots of past resources and knowledge, are
   there time where you have to create something completely new from scratch?
   Are these languages being updated as we go?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would have added more backgrounds, more levels of various difficulties, and animation.
   The overall tone of this project was the system looking down on the user and taunting the user that s/he lacks the skill to beat the level.
   Therefore, I would have liked to add a death counter, counting each death (each time the player loses) and possibly allow the player to unlock
   certain achievements/skills as their death counter hits a certain number. I would also give an award for each level they complete, but could just be a praise.
   I also wanted to create a sound game where the game plays a certain melody like Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars or Bad Guy by Billie Eilish and the player has to play it back.
   If I set each button like a piano I believe it could've been possible. Something like a Jubeat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzmQQzufs0g&ab_channel=%EA%B9%80%EC%A7%80%EC%88%98)
   Definitely adding some animation in the background would be cool as the levels get higher like meteors falling in the back for Level ? (Extreme)
   I would like to have change the alert text when the player loses. Have multiple ones and making it a but interactive with the user. Kind of like Hades (nintendo switch game)
   This I believe can definitely be achieved even with me so it sucks I couldn't get to it.
